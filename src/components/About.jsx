      <p>
I am a fresh software developer with a strong foundation in the latest practices of web development, 
gained through hands-on experience during my studies at Keyin College. Iâ€™ve built dynamic, 
user-focused web applications utilizing languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and 
libraries like React. My backend development experience includes working with databases 
and server-side programming.
<br /><br />
Alongside my web development expertise, I have a deep passion for data systems and 
AI-driven solutions. I specialize in building efficient ETL pipelines, managing relational 
databases, and creating insightful dashboards with tools like Power BI. My skills extend 
to Python programming, cloud platforms like Azure and GCP, and developing AI-powered 
applications through available APIs. I bring a creative and solution-focused mindset to every project, blending 
web development and data expertise with strategic problem-solving to deliver innovative, impactful results.
<br /><br />
My lifestyle of learning and problem solving extends beyond development. I am the chess club director for central Newfoundland      
where I coach young students to play chess on a competitive level while also hosting chess club meets for the general public.</p>
